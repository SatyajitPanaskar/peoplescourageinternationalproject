        "The intense heat of brick kilns is familiar to Ateeq Khan, a resident of Narayach village in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Ateeq has worked as a labourer in brick kilns since the age of fifteen. He is the primary breadwinner for his family, which includes his elderly parents, wife, and five children. His work at the kiln involves placing raw bricks into the furnace and removing them once ready. For this labour-intensive task, he earns 300 rupees (less than $4) a day. Extreme heat combined with continuous exposure to dust and pollution has made the task of handling bricks challenging, often hampering Ateeqâ€™s ability to work. He frequently suffers from health issues due to the heat.",
