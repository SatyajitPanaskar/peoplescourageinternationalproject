                110 million Indonesians across 60 cities of the country are
                exposed to the impacts of climate change, with the poor being
                highly vulnerable. [6] Current estimates for climate migrants in
                the country are unavailable.

                Indonesiaâ€™s Jakarta is a well-known example of the environmental
                impacts of rapid urbanisation. It has been projected to be the
                fastest-sinking city globally [7], and is estimated to sink 95%
                by 2050. [8] Such a catastrophic event could lead to large-scale
                migration out of the city
