                Long-term migration is prevalent in Indonesia as opposed to
                short-term migration
              </h3>
              <p>
                Indonesia has been experiencing rapid growth in urban areas,
                with 54% of the population residing there, expected to further
                increase to 68% by 2050.[9] Migration movements in the country
                are mainly for longer durations as a result of its archipelagic
                landscape making air travel the most prominent mode of transport
                however extremely expensive. As a result, the combination of
                distant destinations and high travel costs encourage migrants to
                relocate for longer durations.[10]

                Due to rapid urbanisation and frequent flooding, Jakarta is
                predicted to sink 95% by 2050.
              </h3>
              <p>
                According to the Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID
                2022), there were 300,000 disasters in Indonesia causing
                internal displacement in the country. Research has indicated
                that out migration as a result of the increasing temperature and
                variation in rainfall will have a greater impact than disasters
                in the country.[11] Furthermore, it is important to note that
                the country has experienced impacts of climate change in
                destination areas as well. Indonesia’s Jakarta is a well-known
                example of the environmental impacts of rapid urbanisation. It
                has been projected to be the fastest-sinking city globally[12],
                and is estimated to sink 95% by 2050.[13] In response, the
                Indonesian government is planning to shift its capital to
                Nusantara.

                The new labour regulations in the country are more focused on
                investors and reviving the economy post pandemic
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Labour Rights Index (2022) highlights the presence of
                ‘limited access to decent work’ in Indonesia.[14] Studies have
                also indicated that compliance with existing laws is limited.
                For instance, a survey conducted in the garment sector in Asia
                found a non-compliance rate of 39.1% with the minimum wage
                regulations in Indonesia.[15] Following the pandemic, the labour
                laws have also undergone significant changes. The government
                enacted the ‘Omnibus Law’ aimed to attract investors and revive
                the economy post-pandemic. However, union members and experts
                have critiqued that these laws disregard labour rights. For
                instance, the law granted firms the freedom to exceed
                government-set limits for working hours and overtime.[16]
                Eventually, the court deemed the law unconstitutional and stated
                that it needed to be amended or replaced.[17] In December 2022,
                the Indonesian government issued an emergency regulation to
                replace the law. However, critics have argued that this new law
                was not any different from the previous, as majority of its
                provisions remained unchanged.[18]

                Portability constraints in schemes lead to limited access for
                internal migrants
              </h3>
              <p>
                27.8% (excluding health insurance schemes) of the Indonesian
                population is covered by at least one social security
                scheme.[19] Migrant workers face significant challenges when
                accessing schemes at destination locations. Even though social
                security schemes are portable in Indonesia, several constraints
                exist. For example, accessing the healthcare insurance scheme
                outside the registration area has certain conditions leading to
                inaccessibility for migrants.[20] For other schemes that provide
                direct government aid, the lack of migrant registries and the
                ability of local government bodies to keep track of migrants’
                current residence has restricted access for them.
