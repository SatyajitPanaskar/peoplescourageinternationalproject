                Large-scale internal migration has impacted both rural and urban
                areas in the Philippines
              </h3>
              <p>
                The 2020 Census of Population and Housing observed, 30.6% of
                Filipinos moved to or lived in another area within domestic
                borders.[8] Most of those who move internally from rural to
                urban locations, generally migrate at a relatively young age
                impacting overall conditions in both areas. Research has
                indicated that as the young population moves from rural areas,
                it leaves a deficit in the labour force. This could eventually
                lead to a decline in agricultural production and an increasingly
                ageing population. Consequently, urban areas are strained as a
                result of increased housing and infrastructural requirements
                leading to a further increase in informal settlements.[9]

                Rising temperatures and sea levels have led to an increase in
                internal migration
              </h3>
              <p>
                As a result of climate change, the Philippines has experienced
                an increase in temperature and sea level rise in coastal cities
                leading to an increase in internal migration. Experts have found
                that increased temperature has resulted in a high out migration
                from rural areas owing to low agricultural productivity.
                Simultaneously, the increase in sea level has led to more
                instances of typhoons and hence displacement.[10] For example,
                the sea level in the capital city of Manila is found to be
                rising “more than four times faster than the global
                average”.[11] Furthermore, it is estimated that by the end of
                the century, 60 million people who reside in the coastal areas
                will be forced to move as a result of rising sea levels in the
                country.[12]

                Labour Rights Index score higher than the regional average in

              </h3>
              <p>
                According to the Labour Rights Index (2022), Philippines has
                ‘reasonable access to work’, its score being higher than the
                overall average in the Southeast Asian region.[13] However,
                compliance related challenges exist in the country. For example,
                in the garment sector, the non-compliance rate with minimum wage
                is 53.3% with a significant gender compliance gap i.e.,
                14.3%.[14]

                The Philippines is moving towards a uniform digital national ID
                to overcome documentation challenges
              </h3>
              <p>
                Social safety nets in the Philippines have focused on three
                major themes which include food subsidies, public employment
                programs and credit-based livelihood programs.[15] In 2019, it
                was observed 36.7% of the population had coverage of social
                protection schemes in the country while 90.4% of the population
                was covered by the health insurance scheme.[16] As a response to
                major documentation and identity proof related challenges to
                access schemes the government recently launched the Philippine
                Identification System (PhilSys), creating a uniform digital ID
                for its nationals.[17] However, since its launch the ID
                registrations and roll out has faced numerous administrative
                challenges with physical IDs having only reached 37 million
                approximately out of the 80 million target.[18] With most
                government and private benefits requiring this ID, if not rolled
                out to the entire population significant access related
                challenges could be faced in the future.
