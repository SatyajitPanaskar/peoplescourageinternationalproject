                Bangladesh is witnessing rapid increase in rural to urban
                migration
              </h3>
              <p>
                There has been a large increase in rural to urban migration in
                Bangladesh in the last 15 years.[11] This has been driven by
                urbanisation and the associated boom in the manufacturing
                sector. Rise in ready-made garment factories has fuelled
                migration among women[12], who make up 80% of the employees in
                the sector.[13]

                Climate change – both slow-onset and extreme events – are
                fuelling rural to urban migration in Bangladesh :
              </h3>
              <p>
                In 2019, climate related impacts led to the displacement of 4.1
                million people, and migration of 455,941 mainly due to
                slow-onset climate change within Bangladesh.[14] Further
                predictions suggest by 2050, the country could have 13.3 million
                internal climate migrants[15], accounting for a third of all in
                South Asia.[16] Major push factors for climate migration are
                associated with the lack of productivity in agriculture during
                lean seasons, annual flooding and recurrent food crises. These
                continue to push vulnerable communities such as farmers and
                landless labourers in distress to migrate to other regions of
                Bangladesh, increasing internal migration.[17] For example, the
                northern region is faced with a recurring seasonal event,
                commonly referred to as ‘monga’ which creates a near-famine
                situation between the periods of cultivation and harvest,
                leading to annual labour migration in the region.[18]

                Challenges directly linked to labour laws increase vulnerability
                of migrant workers:
              </h3>
              <p>
                Migrant workers are often paid less and made to work more. For
                example, there exists a huge gap between the minimum wage and
                living wage, especially in Dhaka.[19] The current minimum wage
                in Bangladesh is the lowest in the Asia and Pacific region
                excluding sectors in which migrant workers are employed such as
                agriculture and domestic work.[20] The data on the Labour Rights
                Index also shows that there is a total lack of decent work in
                the country, suggesting challenges in compliance with the
                existing labour laws.[21] For instance, 50% of the workers in 18
                ready-made garment factories exceeded the overtime limit.[22]

                Design of existing schemes makes it challenging for migrants to
                access benefits:
              </h3>
              <p>
                There are over 142 social security schemes in Bangladesh.[23]
                However, migrants face challenges in accessing them, primarily
                due to lack of portability. This is because schemes are designed
                based on geographical area, making migrants ‘ineligible’ when
                they move to a different geography for work.[24]
